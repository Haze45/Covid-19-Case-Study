🗂️ Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on COVID-19 datasets, focusing on infection trends, deaths, recoveries, and rates across countries and provinces. The analysis is divided across two Jupyter Notebooks:

* Covid19.ipynb – Core data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analyses.

* Covid19_7.ipynb – Advanced metrics,Data Merging,Combined Data Analysis, comparisons, and visualizations.

📁 Notebooks
✅ 1. Covid19.ipynb – Data Preparation and Initial Insights
Contents:
* Data Loading: Reads confirmed, deaths, and recovered datasets.

* Data Cleaning:
    ->Replaces blank values in the Province/State column with "All Provinces".
    ->Removes the first row if it's metadata or unnecessary.
    ->Handles missing values using forward fill for time-series integrity.

*Data Transformation:
    ->Converts wide-format data to long-format using pd.melt().
    ->Ensures date columns are converted to datetime objects.

*Trend Analysis:
    ->Peak daily new cases in Germany, France, and Italy.
    ->Visualization of the peaks using bar graphs.

✅ 2. Covid19_7.ipynb – Deeper Analysis and Comparisons
Contents:
*Recovery Rate Analysis:
    ->Calculates and compares recovery rates between Canada and Australia as of December 31, 2020.
    ->Visualizes the comparison using bar plots.

*Death Rate Analysis in Canada:
    ->Computes death rates per province.
    ->Identifies the highest and lowest death rate provinces.
    ->Handles divisions by zero (e.g., Diamond Princess).
    ->Bar chart visualization.

*Total Deaths and Daily Averages:
    ->Computes total deaths per country as of the latest date.
    ->Calculates average daily deaths and ranks the top 5 countries.
    ->Visual representation using bar charts.

*United States Time Series: 
    ->Analyzes and visualizes how cumulative deaths evolved over time in the US.

📊 Datasets Used
Three CSV files:
*covid_19_confirmed_v1_lyst*.csv
*covid_19_deaths_v1_lyst*.csv
*covid_19_recovered_v1_lyst*.csv

📌 Key Insights
*Germany experienced the highest single-day surge among Germany, France, and Italy.
*Canada had a higher recovery rate than Australia by end of 2020.
*Provinces in Canada had varying death rates, with some special cases (e.g., cruise ships).
*The US showed a consistent increase in total deaths, with visual trends available over time.
*The top countries by average daily deaths provide insight into the global severity.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
*Pandas for data manipulation
*Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
*NumPy for numerical operations
*Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
